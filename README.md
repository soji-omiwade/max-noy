Solving the algorithmic/programming problems at http://maxnoy.com/interviews.html
From 1b, started using TDD with Python's unittest

1) Linked lists
    a) singly linked lists ... done
    b) circular singly linked lists (inherits from 1a) ... done 
    b-2) multi-threading with circular singly linked lists, where one thread processes (outputs the node key), 
        and another thread inserts at the tail. This mimics the way an OS adds jobs to be processed to its queue, while
        processing jobs already in the queue.
    c) sorted lists (bout to start)
2) Strings 
3) Binary Trees
4) Arrays
5) Queues
